    // On Metabolism & Calorie Science
    { title: "On Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)", text: "Your BMR is the energy your body burns just to stay alive (breathing, circulating blood). Your diet plan is designed to provide energy above this baseline, so you stay healthy and energized." },
    { title: "On Energy Density", text: "This meal (like a large salad) has a low energy density. This means you can eat a large, filling volume for relatively few calories, which is key to feeling satisfied." },
    { title: "On Plateaus", text: "It is completely normal to hit a weight loss plateau. This is your body adjusting to its new weight. Stay consistent, and we can review your activity and intake to make a small change." },
    { title: "On 'Starvation Mode'", text: "Eating too few calories (e.g., under 1200) can backfire. Your body may slow its metabolism to conserve energy. A moderate, controlled deficit is the only sustainable way to lose fat." },

    // On Macronutrients (Protein, Fat, Fiber)
    { title: "On Fiber (General)", text: "Fiber is your secret weapon. This meal is high in fiber, which slows down digestion, keeps you full for hours, and helps stabilize your blood sugar." },
    { title: "On Protein (Muscle)", text: "Why so much protein? When you're in a calorie deficit, your body can burn muscle for energy. Eating adequate protein tells your body to burn fat instead and preserve that vital muscle." },
    { title: "On Healthy Fats (Hormones)", text: "The healthy fats in this meal (from nuts/seeds) are essential. They are crucial for producing hormones, managing inflammation, and helping you absorb vitamins A, D, E, and K." },
    { title: "On Whole Grains vs. Refined", text: "We've chosen a whole grain (like brown rice) instead of white. It provides steady, slow-release energy, avoiding the blood sugar spike and 'crash' that leaves you hungry again." },

    // On Clinical/Medical Topics
    { title: "For Diabetics (Low GI)", text: "This meal is designed to be Low Glycemic (Low GI). It will raise your blood sugar slowly and steadily, preventing the dangerous 'spikes' that can damage blood vessels." },
    { title: "For Hypertensives (Sodium)", text: "This meal is seasoned with herbs and spices instead of excess salt. Reducing your sodium intake is one of the most powerful non-drug ways to help lower your blood pressure." },
    { title: "For PCOS (Insulin)", text: "For managing PCOS, controlling insulin is key. This meal's balance of protein and fiber is specifically designed to improve your body's insulin sensitivity." },
    { title: "For High Cholesterol (Soluble Fiber)", text: "The soluble fiber in this meal (from oats/beans) acts like a sponge. It binds to cholesterol in your gut and helps escort it out of your body." },

    // On Behavior, Adherence & Mindset
    { title: "On Hydration", text: "Feeling hungry? You might just be thirsty. Drink a full glass of water before this meal. It aids digestion and significantly helps with feeling full." },
    { title: "On Mindful Eating", text: "Try to eat this meal without distractions (no TV or phone). Focus on the taste and texture. This 'mindful eating' helps your brain register fullness and improves satisfaction." },
    { title: "On Cravings", text: "A craving is just a thought, it's not a command. When one strikes, pause, drink some water, and wait 15 minutes. It will often pass. If not, have your planned healthy snack." },
    { title: "On 'A Bad Day'", text: "One unhealthy meal doesn't ruin your progress, just as one healthy meal doesn't make you healthy. The key is consistency, not perfection. Get right back on track with your next meal." },

    // On Motivation & General Health
    { title: "On Non-Scale Victories", text: "Don't just watch the scale! Are your clothes fitting looser? Do you have more energy to play with your kids? Are you sleeping better? These 'Non-Scale Victories' are just as important." },
    { title: "On Sleep", text: "Prioritize your sleep! Less than 7 hours of sleep can increase your hunger hormone (ghrelin) and your stress hormone (cortisol), making it physically harder to lose weight." },
    { title: "On Activity", text: "You can't out-exercise a poor diet, but exercise is your best partner. Even a 30-minute walk helps your body use insulin better and builds muscle that burns calories 24/7." },
    { title: "On Gut Health", text: "The variety of vegetables in your plan isn't just for vitamins. It feeds the healthy bacteria in your gut. A healthy gut microbiome is linked to easier weight management and less inflammation." }
