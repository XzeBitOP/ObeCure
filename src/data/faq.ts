  {
    question: '1. Why do I keep losing motivation after a few days?',
    answer: [
      'Because motivation is emotional, not logical. It fades when you rely on willpower alone.',
      'Build systems — fixed meal times, set reminders, visible goals. Discipline outlasts motivation.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '2. Why do I crave sweets or fried food even when I’m not hungry?',
    answer: [
      'Cravings are emotional, not physical. They rise with stress, boredom, or fatigue.',
      '💡 Tip: Drink water, take a short walk, or eat a high-protein snack — cravings fade in 10–15 minutes.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '3. Why do I feel guilty after eating something “unhealthy”?',
    answer: [
      'Because you were trained to see food as “good” or “bad.”',
      'In reality, only habits are good or bad.',
      'Guilt raises cortisol, which makes fat loss harder.',
      'Instead: note the trigger → forgive yourself → move on.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '4. Why am I so self-conscious about my body?',
    answer: [
      'Because you’ve been made to feel like your body defines your worth.',
      'It doesn’t. Your body is a living record of your environment, stress, hormones, and history — not your failure.',
      'You’re healing, not “fixing” yourself.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '5. Why does stress make me eat more?',
    answer: [
      'Stress raises cortisol and lowers serotonin — your body craves sugar to rebalance it.',
      'Replace stress-eating with relief actions: slow breathing, a walk, journaling, or calling a friend.',
      'You can’t remove stress, but you can change your response.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '6. Why do I feel tired even after sleeping enough?',
    answer: [
      'Because fat loss isn’t only about sleep hours — it’s about sleep quality.',
      'Late-night screen time, caffeine, or anxiety reduce deep sleep.',
      'Try sleeping before 11 PM and limiting blue light after 9 PM.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '7. Why do people’s comments about my weight hurt so much?',
    answer: [
      'Because weight stigma attacks identity, not health.',
      'You’re working on change; they’re stuck on judgment.',
      'Every time someone comments, remind yourself: “I’m doing what they aren’t — taking responsibility.”',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '8. Why do I compare my progress to others?',
    answer: [
      'Because we live in a highlight-reel culture.',
      'Metabolism, hormones, and stress levels differ for everyone.',
      'The only fair comparison is you vs. your past self.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '9. Why do I lose weight and then gain it back?',
    answer: [
      'Because most “diets” teach restriction, not regulation.',
      'When you eat too little, your metabolism slows.',
      'When you eat normally again, your body stores extra as defense.',
      'ObeCure fixes this by teaching metabolic balance — not starvation.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '10. Why am I scared of failing again?',
    answer: [
      'Because every failed diet made you associate “starting” with “disappointment.”',
      'This time, start smaller. Instead of perfection, aim for consistency.',
      'You’ll win once your habits feel effortless — not extreme.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '11. Why do I feel hungrier after workouts?',
    answer: [
      'Your body is asking for fuel to recover — it’s a good sign.',
      'Don’t panic.',
      'Just eat protein and fiber after workouts — not sugar.',
      'Your metabolism is learning efficiency.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '12. Why do I feel emotional or sad during my journey?',
    answer: [
      'As fat decreases, stored toxins and hormones release into the bloodstream temporarily.',
      'Emotionally, you’re also breaking old comfort cycles.',
      'It’s healing — not regression.',
      'Drink more water, rest well, and give your body time.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '13. Why do I get body aches and fatigue in the first week?',
    answer: [
      'Because your body is adapting.',
      'New workouts trigger micro-tears in muscles — it’s a positive sign.',
      'Stretch, hydrate, and sleep well. Your endurance will double in 10 days.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '14. Why does my weight fluctuate daily?',
    answer: [
      'Because of water retention, hormones, and bowel movements.',
      'Ignore daily changes — track weekly averages.',
      'Fat loss is steady; water weight is noisy.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '15. Why does everyone around me eat junk and still stay slim?',
    answer: [
      'They may have faster metabolism, or they’re gaining internally (fat around organs) without knowing it.',
      'Health isn’t how you look — it’s how your blood reports look.',
      'You’re building metabolic health, not chasing an illusion.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '16. Why do I feel like I’ll never reach my goal?',
    answer: [
      'That’s the brain protecting you from disappointment.',
      'Break big goals into mini goals: “Lose 2 kg” → “Sleep by 11 PM” → “Walk 5000 steps.”',
      'Every small win rebuilds belief.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '17. Why do I sabotage myself when progress begins?',
    answer: [
      'Because deep down, your mind fears change.',
      'The brain loves familiarity — even if it’s unhealthy.',
      'Recognize this self-sabotage moment and say:',
      '“It’s safe for me to improve.”',
      'Progress will feel natural after repetition.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '18. Why do I feel like my body is fighting against me?',
    answer: [
      'It’s not — it’s trying to protect you.',
      'When you’ve been overweight for long, your body thinks that’s “safe.”',
      'Be patient; consistent signals (balanced food, sleep, hydration) will retrain your set point.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '19. Why don’t I feel confident when I look in the mirror?',
    answer: [
      'Confidence isn’t built by mirrors — it’s built by action.',
      'Start celebrating non-scale victories: fitting into clothes, breathing easier, better energy, improved reports.',
      'The mirror will catch up later.',
    ],
  },
  {
    question: '20. What if I never feel happy with my body?',
    answer: [
      'Then shift focus from appearance to performance.',
      'Ask: “Can I walk faster? Sleep better? Focus more?”',
      'When your body functions better, your mind starts appreciating it automatically.',
    ],
  },
